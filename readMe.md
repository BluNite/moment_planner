### deployed@ https://blunite.github.io/moment_planner/

## Criteria Acceptance is

```md
GIVEN when using the planner, I can create a schedule and save it to local storage
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the planner
WHEN I scroll down there are time-blocks in sync with the time of day between normal business hours
WHEN viewing the time-blocks for the day
Then each time_block is color coded to reflect past, present, future position relative to current time
WHEN I click on a text-area time block
THEN I can enter an event
When I click on the save button the message is saved
When I click on the delete button the message is deleted
When I refresh the page, data is saved into localStorage
Then Saved or Deleted messages persist
```

## Challenges/Observations ðŸ’¡

```md
I studied documents on momentsJs and StackOverflow that featured stagnate time,
a loop that maintains the hour-boxes as an
alternative to time_boxes text displayed through text. Added a delete button.
```
